This driver adapts the existing CP210x driver for Linux 4.x to support PPS,
such as provided by a USB GPS.  This has been tested with the Ubuntu 18.04
LTS 4.15.0-46.49 kernel and a Jackson Labs &ldquo;Firefly&rdquo; Global
Positioning System Disciplined Oscillator (GPSDO).

It is assumed that this driver works with all 4.x kernels.

Note: this driver is in a prerelease form; the code here does not match the
tested driver.
